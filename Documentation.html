<h1>Beethoven in the House: Model documentation</h1>
<p>
This document provides an overview of a structural model that aims to support the association of multiple source materials and the development of comparative musicological research, as designed for use in the <em>Beethoven in the House</em> research project. Although the model has, thus far, only been assessed within this project, we anticipate wider applicability encompassing other sources and musicological investigations.

<h2 id="Model">Model</h2>
</p>
<p>
We present our multi-layered, conceptual model for associating musical source materials to musicological arguments. We  describe our proposal for operationalizing these concepts through a framework for musical annotation. Briefly stated, this model shows how portions of digitised data in various files and formats can be identified, selected, labelled, and compared.
</p>
<p>
The following chart presents a top-down view.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/diagram1.png" width="" alt="Diagram of the model" title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<p>
Each layer in the model corresponds to one of the three main categories of objects that represent our data:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence Objects</strong> &#8211; digitised sources;
<li><strong>Musical Objects</strong> &#8211; user-selected musical elements and their aggregates in various relevant combinations; and
<li><strong>Musicological Objects</strong> &#8211; their musicological labelling and scholarly commentary.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Prior to primary scholarly activity, in this case research commentary involving multiple sources, a series of steps must be completed including identification of available resources, selection of items of interest, and addressing locations in these sources. The two lower levels of the model are therefore, generally speaking, concerned with collecting the desired data, while the upper level involves critical judgement.
</p>
<p>
A bottom-up introduction to these structures follows.
</p>

<h3 id="EvidenceObjects">EVIDENCE OBJECTS</h3>
<p>
These are digitised materials that will be used for the musicological
investigation. They include images of musical scores and the MEI encodings
(stored in project repositories and digital libraries), music recordings (in the
form of audio files and digital video), text documents, and links to secondary
source materials, such as books and articles.

<p>
<strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">Resources</span></code></strong> refer to
complete documents or files which can be unambiguously identified using a
Universal Resource Identifier (URI). Typically we would expect to be able to
access these.

<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>an encoded music file: <a

</p>
<p>
<strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">References</span></code></strong> are places
or regions within a <code>Resource</code>, and are also identified using
URIs.

<p>
<br><strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the XML ID of an MEI element: <a

MUSICAL OBJECTS
<p>
These refer to the music that will be investigated, be it in whole or in part,
in notated, image, audio or video format. The types of musical objects refer to
the various levels of collection and abstraction pertinent to the musical
research, closely following FRBR principles. FRBR terminology is used whenever
possible, although there are particularities pertaining to the domain of music
which we reflect through our use of FRBR subclasses. Any of these musical
objects may be the target of an <code>Observation</code>.

<p>
A <strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">Selection</span></code></strong> is the
lowest level of grouping musical references. It contains the complete set of
URIs for the individual components of a musical extract, be that a single
resource, or multiple resources derived from a single source of material, such
as a set of orchestral parts. It is a subclass of
<code>frbr:Manifestation</code> because it gathers together digitised
embodiments of a <a href="#bookmark=id.d9wtiw76t0oi">musical source</a>. Every
<code>Selection</code> must be part of an <code>Extract</code> because it is
assumed that every piece potentially has at least two manifestations: one
written and one performed.

<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>an area on the surface of the score
<li>part of a music audio/video file
<li>a passage in the instrumental parts of the same musical score
</li>
</ul>

<a href="#heading=h.ufl6veu55skc"> Appendix: A and B</a> for RDF examples
</p>
<p>
An <strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">Extract</span></code></strong> collects
various instances of a feature or passage. It is used to gather
<code>Selections</code> from different media representing a musical source (this
may mean multiple manifestations – for example, a scan of a particular edition
and a recording based on this edition). Extracts may be grouped together as
<code>ma:setting</code> of a <code>MusicalMaterial</code> (see below), a unique
musical expression.

<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>a single <code>Selection</code>
<li>a combination of <code>Selections</code> from different sources, such as the
XML IDs of consecutive measures in an MEI file and the timestamps of its
corresponding section in an audio file
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">MusicalMaterial</span></code></strong> is an
abstract entity that refers to the musical concept behind a music extract, such
as a passage, phrase or fragment. It is primarily used to group a particular
aspect of a musical extract with an analogous – or what we are calling a
<em>parallel</em> – moment or passage in distinct versions of a musical work.
<code>MusicalMaterial</code> represents a single musical thought, independent of
its various manifestations in different arrangements or recordings (or, in a
variation set, within a single variation).

<p>
Since it is an abstraction, <code>MusicalMaterial</code> does not necessarily
have a notated expression. It can correspond to just a “core” musical thought or
be identical with one of its expressions, according to the scholar’s
interpretation of the music.  <code>MusicalMaterial</code> can refer to any
segment of music, independent of formal structures. It is a subclass of
<code>frbr:Expression</code> because it represents the realisation of a
<code>MusicalIdea</code>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the recapitulation section in two arrangements of the same work
<li>a citation from a piece that is featured in another piece: the Dies Irae
theme in the 4th movement of Berlioz’s <em>Symphonie fantastique</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">MusicalIdea</span></code></strong> is an
abstract entity that refers to the musical thought behind a recurring musical
structure, such as a theme or a motiv. Although it is similar to
<code>MusicalMaterial</code> in the sense that it is an abstraction,
<code>MusicalIdea</code> primarily groups elements that can be found not only in
parallel passages in different musical pieces but also within a single musical
piece, and consequently has greater affinity with established musical
structures. As <code>MusicalMaterial</code>, <code>MusicalIdea</code> is
abstract and does not require a notated form. It is a subclass of  frbr:Work
because it is an idealised “seed” of its multiple expressions throughout a
musical piece.

<p>
<code>MusicalIdeas</code>, as abstractions, must be realised in the form of
<code>MusicalMaterial</code>. Even if the <code>MusicalMaterial</code> only
occurs in one version, it represents the concept behind a passage, and could
recur (i.e. a second expression of the same <code>MusicalIdea</code> always
potentially exists).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the entries of a subject in a fugue
<li>a motiv that is repeated and developed in a sonata-form piece
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
MUSICOLOGICAL OBJECTS
<p>
Whereas the previous layers describe and structure musicological evidence,
Musicological Objects enable us to document musicological research. These
objects are used to describe, compare and record historical context associated
with the collected musical objects, as well as to present hypotheses, link them
to non-musical sources and make scholarly commentary. This is accomplished using
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Web Annotation</a>
standard, capturing annotations along with their motivation and provenance.

<p>
<strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">Observations</span></code></strong> usually
contain a simple textual remark that targets a musical object. In most cases, it
will be used to label such objects or to present one of their relevant features.
<code>Observations</code> aim to be objective, non-controversial, or traditional
descriptions, so that they can be reused.

<p>
<code>Observations</code> might also target <code>References</code> of
non-musical objects relevant to the research, such as letters (as text or as
image) or historical newspaper advertisements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>a label: “This is the theme A of this sonata-form movement.”
<li>something notable: “There is a <em>fff</em> (fortississimo) marking here.”
<li>a description: “The development section starts with bassoon and oboe playing
the main motiv.”
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">Relationships</span></code></strong> are used
to juxtapose more than one musical object by connecting
<code>Observations</code>, <code>Commentaries</code> and other
<code>Relationships</code>. They also aim to be a simple text remark, usually
noting a commonality, a substitution, an addition or a deletion between
<code>Observations</code>. More complex details, such as the reason for a
particular change, are recorded in <code>Commentaries</code>.

<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>a comparison: “The <em>fff</em> (fortississimo) marking in version A was
substituted by an <em>ff</em> (fortissimo) in version B.”
<li>noting a common pattern: “The  <em>fff</em> to <em>ff</em> substitution
occurs in these three passages.”
<li>a deletion: “The introduction was suppressed in version B.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><code><span
style="text-decoration:underline;">Commentaries</span></code></strong> are used
to make more complex comparisons, bring attention to relevant aspects of the
music and to present hypotheses to explain any differences observed.
<code>Commentaries</code> can also present historical or analytical reflections
informed by academic research, including pointers to external sources and
references.

<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>a comparison: “The bassoon part in the orchestra version has staccatos that
were substituted by a pizzicato in the violoncello in the piano trio version.
This represents a deliberate change of articulation since the violoncello is
capable of playing it as written in the orchestra version.”
<li>a notable event: “At this time, <em>fff</em> markings were absolutely rare.
They were probably introduced in the musical vocabulary by Beethoven himself,
and even then they figure only in three of his works (see SHEER 1998, 361).”
<li>a hypothesis: “This substitution of staccatos by pizzicatos may have been
done due to the change in instrumentation.”
</li>
</ul>
